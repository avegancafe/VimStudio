A simple neovim configuration with easy configuration via [fennel-lang](https://fennel-lang.org/) and lua.

To install, simply run the following:

```bash
$ brew install neovim
$ git clone git@github.com:avegancafe/VimStudio.git ~/.config/nvim
```

After cloning, you are good to run `vim`. It will bootstrap itself by installing all of its necessary
plugins. After finishing setting up Hotpot, lazy.nvim, and treesitter, it should
be ready to go!
